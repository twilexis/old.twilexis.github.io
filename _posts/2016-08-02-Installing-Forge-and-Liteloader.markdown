First thing we need to do is [download minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en/download/ "minecraft.net") and run the installer.

Once you have done that, open minecraft and click Edit Profile, which is located under the Profile dropdown on the bottom left.

Scroll down to Use Version, click the dropdown and change the version to 1.9 and click save. Click 'Play' then once it's on the splash screen, close minecraft entirely.

Go to the [Forge website.](http://files.minecraftforge.net/ "Forge")

Navigate to the correct version of forge and download.

Go to your downloads folder and install forge (download and install [java](http://www.java.com/en/) if .jar doesnâ€™t run)

Open minecraft and change the version to Forge. It should be at the very bottom of the version dropdown list.

Run minecraft to the splash screen then close. 

Download [liteloader.](http://www.liteloader.com/download "liteloader website")

Installing liteloader so it runs with forge is one extra step. Click the dropdown next to Extend From and select the version of Forge. You can rename the profile at this step if you like by editing the New Profile box, then click Okay.

Open mincraft and change the version to forge + liteloader.

Run minecraft to the splash page then close. 

Open your .minecraft folder by using Windows + R and typing in %appdata% and pressing enter.

Navigate to .minecraft and locate the mods folder. This is where your mods will be going. I recommend installing mods and running minecraft one at a time in order of preference so if any mods conflict it's easier to troubleshoot.

And you're done! My next step is writing a quick rundown of the mods allowed on PvE and Creative, as well as providing alternatives.
